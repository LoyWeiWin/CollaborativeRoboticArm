### Introduction
This repo is dedicated for anything related to 3D Printing procedure. Given that 3D printing extruders come in different shape and form, this repo is just a fundamental guide to higlight some of the things you should be aware of. This repo will cover some fundamental in relation to the arduino in relation to 3D printing as well as techniques where you connect directly to the controlbox.
