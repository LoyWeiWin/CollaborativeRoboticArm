# Robotic Fabrication with Grasshopper

## Overview
Hi everyone!

This repo is dedicated to using Rhino-Grasshopper with the Robot plugin, showcasing how Rhino-Grasshopper can assist in design-fabrication processes.

## Features
- **Parametric Design**: Leverage Grasshopper's capabilities to design parametric artefact.
- **Robotic Control**: Access scripts for various robot (mostly UR).
- **Toolpath Generation**: Create precise toolpaths for different fabrication processes.
- **Simulation**: Visualize and simulate robotic movements before execution.
- **Modular Workflows**: Adaptable workflows for different robots and fabrication techniques.

## Useful Resources
- **Robot Plugin**: [Robots Plugin](https://github.com/visose/Robots)
- **Universal Robot (Offline Simulator)**: [URSim-Grasshopper-Link](https://github.com/a-vi-shek/URSim-Grasshopper-Link)


## Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository**: `git clone https://github.com/LoyWeiWin/CollaborativeRoboticArm.git`
2. **Install Dependencies**: Follow the `README.md` for plugin installation.
3. **Explore Examples**: Learn from provided example projects.
4. **Customize**: Adapt scripts to your project needs and contribute back.
