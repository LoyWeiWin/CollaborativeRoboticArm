## Introduction

Grasshopper is a visual programming language and environment that runs within the Rhino 3D CAD software. It is widely used for parametric design, allowing designers to create complex forms and patterns through algorithms and data-driven processes.

This repository contains a variety of Grasshopper definitions that cover a wide range of functionalities. Whether you're working on architectural designs, geometric explorations, or parametric modeling, you'll find useful scripts here to streamline your process.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders based on the type of functionality provided by the Grasshopper definitions. Each folder contains:

- Grasshopper definition files (`.gh`)
- A README file explaining the purpose and usage of the definitions within that folder
