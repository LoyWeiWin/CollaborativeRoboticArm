### Note

When working with Universal Robots (UR), sending large amounts of code directly can be problematic. This repository provides a solution by using conditional statements to send code in manageable batches. The robot receives and executes the next batch of code only after reaching specified locations, facilitating efficient and reliable operations. Please note that this grasshopper definition contains python and C# script for batching and retriving real-time data exchange from UR.
