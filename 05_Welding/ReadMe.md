## Introduction

This project showcases the use of Grasshopper for robotic welding applications. By integrating Rhino and Grasshopper with robotic arms, we can achieve precise and automated welding tasks, improving efficiency and accuracy in manufacturing processes.

## Features

- **Grasshopper Definitions**: Pre-built Grasshopper scripts for various welding tasks.
- **Robotic Arm Control**: Integration with robotic arm controllers for seamless operation.
- **Customizable Workflows**: Easily adaptable scripts for different welding requirements.
- **Simulation and Visualization**: Real-time simulation of welding paths and operations.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Rhino 6 or later**: Ensure you have Rhino installed on your machine.
- **Grasshopper**: Grasshopper is included with Rhino.
- **Robotic Arm**: A compatible robotic arm with a controller that can interface with Grasshopper.

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/robotic-fabrication-welding.git
    ```

2. Open the project in Rhino and launch Grasshopper.

3. Load the Grasshopper definitions from the `scripts` folder.

## Usage

1. **Open Rhino and Grasshopper**: Start Rhino and open Grasshopper from the command line or the toolbar.

2. **Load Grasshopper Definition**: Open the desired Grasshopper definition file from the `scripts` folder.

3. **Configure Parameters**: Adjust the parameters in the Grasshopper definition to match your welding task requirements.

4. **Run Simulation**: Use the simulation tools in Grasshopper to visualize the welding path and operations.

5. **Execute Welding Task**: Connect to your robotic arm controller and execute the welding task directly from Grasshopper.
